#Survey tool for creating simple survey forms
A simple PHP tool to create simple surveys, complete with prewritten (though hideous) views and a page controller. At this time without any saving option in the survey forms.
This repo is created as a part of a course in PHP MVC frameworks at Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola (BTH).

###Requirements
This PHP tool is written with the Anax-MVC framework in mind. To be able to follow the installation guide requires that you have a clean installation of the Anax-MVC framework width the CDatabase service separately installed in the framework. For further reading, please visit [Anax-MVC](https://github.com/mosbth/Anax-MVC "Anax-MVC on GitHub") and [CDatabase](https://github.com/mosbth/cdatabase "CDatabase on GitHub") on GitHub.
